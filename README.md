Bartering with Gemini (formerly bard)

# What it does

Barterville is designed to challenge users to push their creativity and persuasion skills to the limit. The core of the experience revolves around interacting with various AI characters. The goal is to negotiate trades, starting with lower-value items and working to the highest-value trades. Each decision requires careful consideration, strategic thinking, and understanding of the AI characters’ motivations and behavior.

Used the Gemini API to enhance the intelligence and personalities of each AI trader. After randomly picking different features for the trader and their item, the API takes in a set of instructions and parameters to generate a trader. The API allows us to generate different dialogue options and trade scenarios, guaranteeing that each interaction feels fresh. We also used the API call to verify whether the user’s name was appropriate to create a more secure user environment. By integrating Gemini, we’ve created a fluid and immersive environment where players are encouraged to think critically and adapt their approach depending on the AI’s responses.

The aim for this app was to create a distinct platform for users to sharpen their negotiation skills and bring out their creativity to achieve a common goal. Every word and every path taken is unique and different from the rest. This blend of creativity, strategy, and AI interaction forms the backbone of the app, offering an educational yet entertaining experience for all players. It is just the beginning.
